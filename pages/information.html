            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Elephants are normally killed for many diffrent reasons.
                Throughout this decade, around 75,000 elephants were killed for the ivory trade annually, worth around 1
                billion dollars. About 80% of this was estimated to come from illegally killed elephants.Elephant
                hunting,
                which used to be an accepted activity in Kenya, was banned in 1973, as was the ivory trade. Illegal
                hunting
                continues, as there is still international demand for elephant tusks. There is a chance that elephants
                might
                get extinct becuase nearly a hundred elephants are slaughtered each day in the wild, most for their
                ivory
                tusks. This killing of elephants by humans could wipe out the animals in the wild within a generation.
            </p>
            <p style="display:inline-block;">This animal is also hunted for their other body parts. Poachers first peel
                their skins away from the ribs and spin. Then they proceed to take out the extra body parts like the
                trunk
                legs ect. The poachers leave the body parts on the forest floor. Many elephants were so damaged that
                reaserchers could not identify their age or gender.</p>

            <p style="display: inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Male Asian elephants, most of which have tusks, have
                suffered the most from the ivory trade. This is by no means a new phenomenon for ivory has been a valued
                substance from time immemorial, where Asian artists and craftsmen transform those tusks into complex and
                beautiful objects. Besides the insatiable lust for ivory products, the burgeoning demand for ivory in
                the
                Asian market makes the illegal ivory trade extremely profitable, and therefore has led to the continued
                slaughter of Asian elephants.</p>

            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Farming and development has lead to vast areas of
                natural
                forest being burned, chopped down, or otherwise destroyed. Because the soil is not ideal for crops (but
                rather for sustaining trees etc...), farmers are often successful only for a few years, after which
                time,
                farmers need to move on and destroy another area for their produce.</p>
            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">As time progresses, farmers are not only destroying more
                areas in their quest for fertile soil, they are also increasing in number. Similarly, the demand for
                development and expansion has also sky-rocketed as the population explodes. Another reason for the
                destruction of rain forests is the increasing need for timber. All of this adds up to more space
                required at
                the expense of the natural rain forests.</p>

            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Elephant-human conflict poses a grave threat to their
                continued existence. Studies on conflict between elephants and humans in Asia and in Africa have
                identified
                crop raiding as the main form of conflict. </p>
            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Elephant-human conflict is a result of habitat loss and
                fragmentation. When elephants and humans interact, there is conflict from crop raiding, injuries and
                deaths
                to humans caused by elephants, and elephants being killed by humans for reasons other than ivory and
                habitat
                degradation</p>
            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Elephants cause damage amounting from a few thousand
                dollars
                to millions of dollars. Every year, 100 humans (in some years it may be 300 people) and 40-50 elephants
                are
                killed during crop raiding in India.</p>
            <p style="display:inline-block;padding-left: 10px;">Such encounters foster resentment against the elephants
                amongst the human population and this can result in elephants being viewed as a nuisance and killed.
                This
                was illustrated in the case of 60 elephants found dead in retaliation incidents in NE India and Sumatra
                in
                2001, poisoned by plantation workers</p>
